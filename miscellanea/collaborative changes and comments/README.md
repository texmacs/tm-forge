## Tools for proposing text changes in collaborative editing

When working on a draft document as a co-author, one often needs to propose changes to the text, were it for a mere typo,
for clarification purposes, etc. And in many cases you would want to justify the proposed change by attaching a comment to it.
Furthermore, when changes are poposed, the process of reviewing them and accepting or rejecting them should be eased through simple keystrokes.

In TeXmacs, the Versioning Tool already provides an easy mechanism to revise changes made to
a document and easily accept or reject them. However it lacks the accompanying comments. And
conversely, the recently added Comment package allows making comments, but if one proposes a
change inside such a comment, it is then very painful to manually implement it. We need the two features combined. 

**This package tries to fill this gap by hacking commenting tools working hand in hand with the versioning Tool**.

My commenting tools were developped before the official Comment package became available (and hence it does not make use of it). I have renamed my stuff to Komment, in order to avoid any confusion.

## How it works
This Komment package provides new "komment" tags for highlighting text chunks that call for a comment and/or a change in the text, together with appropriate commands for introducing and editing them. Komments by multiple authors can co-exist and can be given a different highlighting color. Komments are also time-stamped.

A komment tag can appear as
 - a pop-up balloon when the cursor enters the highlighted region
 - static inline greyed text (e.g. for printing or pdf export)
 - hidden, i.e. showing only the highlighting, for unencumbered editing.

Within this highlighting markup, proposed text modifications are shown as "version-both" tags (with the comment field possibly empty).

At the time of reviewing comments, TeXmac's Versioning tools are used for navigating between komments,
displaying old or new version of text, and finally, accepting or rejecting proposed changes and clearing comments.

The package uses a style file, scheme macros and widgets. Hopefully it can be used as examples of how to use these.

## Usage
For a streamlined use, keyboard shortcuts are defined in my-init-texmacs.scm (I made no menu, although it would be possible).
Below I explain what these do, but they can be defined differently, of course.

#### introducing a komment : Ctl-m 
Select some text beforehand and press Ctl-m. This brings up a text editing widget where you can enter the text of the komment. 
It can be as complicated as you want, contain equations...
At the bottom of the widget, you can change the name of the komment author, and associate a color to that name.

#### Modifying a komment : Ctl-m
You can re-edit an existing komment by placing the cursor in it and pressing again  Ctl-m.

#### Proposing a text change : Ctl-M (think "Modify")
 Select some text beforehand and press Ctl-M. This will automatically introduce a "version-both tag" inside a komment.
 The text that was selected is marked for deletion and the cursor is positionned to enter a replacement text,
 initially set to `Ã—` (i.e. a `<version-suppressed>` tag, meaning it is a pure deletion with no replacement text).
 Conversely, Ctl-M with no initial selection is a pure text addition.
  
At that point the "comment" justifying the change is empty; it can be added afterwards if needed, with Ctl-m.

#### Circulating between different display styles of the komment field : Ctl-/
When using this keyboard shortcut, the resulting display style is shown in the bottom message bar.

#### Toggle considering komment tags as a version tag.
When navigating between the version tags (using the Version menu  `previous difference` or `next difference`),
tells whether komment tags should be considered or ignored. Useful when a text contains both "normal"  version tags and komments tags. 
 
#### Navigating between koments, control their display, accept or reject changes.

same shortcuts as the Version tool menu, made accessible everywhere
  Ctl-up  jump to previous komment 
  Ctl-down jump to next komment
  Ctl-left display old text only
  Ctl-right display proposed new text only
  Ctl-|  display both old and new text
  Ctl-1 retain old text and delete komment  (accept proposed change)
  Ctl-2 retain new text and delete komment (reject proposed change)
If a komment contains no version tag, Ctl-1 and Ctl-2 both clear the komment.


### Limitations
As said above, this package is hacked onto existing features. This means for instance that the komment
tag appears as a variant of the version-* tags, which is nonsense. 
Also some display quirks occur for instance when a comment is inserted in the caption of
a big figure, making it hard to read and edit. This could probably be improved.
